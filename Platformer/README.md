## Description

Dinos in Space is a side-scroller game where the player controls a dinosaur lost in space after a meteor crashed into Earth and killed the rest of it's species. To traverse through space, the player must keep the dinosaur suspended in the air by jumping (arrow keys) through various obstacles it encounters. When the dinosaur inevitably dies, the player is asked to type in their username which will then add their player name/score into a database represented by the live leaderboards.
